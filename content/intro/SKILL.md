# Blog Intro Writer

Write engaging blog intros in the style of high-performing SEO listicles and guides ([examples.md](examples.md#contents)).

## Contents

- [First step](#first-step)
- [Commitments](#commitments)
- [Intro patterns](#intro-patterns)
- [Writing rules](#writing-rules)
- [Slug, title, and image alt](#slug-title-and-image-alt)
- [Default output](#default-output)

- [Quality check](#quality-check)

## When this applies

The user invoked **`/intro`**, or asked for a blog intro, opening paragraph, or lead copy for a post.

Works on its own or after title work (see the `seo-title-optimization` skill). If the slug or title is missing, ask briefly or propose one.

## First step

Say: "Tell me a bit about your content and I'll write an intro for it."

Gather enough to match intent:

- Topic, primary keyword, and search intent (informational, listicle, how-to, comparison)
- Target reader and their goal
- Article shape: listicle count, H2/H3 outline, or key sections
- Product angle, if the post promotes one
- Optional: chosen title, slug, featured image subject

If the user already pasted an outline or draft, use it. Do not invent stats, market share, or legal claims unless they provided them.

## Commitments

I will:

- Use simple, concise English
- Return an image alt text
- Give a slug and a title
- Use lists where they help scanning
- Match the reader's intent to the content
- Introduce the topic and why it matters
- Tell readers what they will learn
- **Journey teaser:** a roadmap of the key steps or sections ahead
- **Explain why:** the practical importance of the topic
- **Relevance:** how the topic relates to the reader's goal
- Use short sentences and keep it short

## Intro patterns

Pick the pattern that fits the article type.

### Listicle (e.g. "21 Best Search Engines")

Reference: [listicle example](examples.md#listicle-search-engines)

1. One sentence: what the thing is.
2. One sentence: why the default option is not enough, or why the list matters.
3. Journey teaser: what the list covers and how it is organized (`grouped by type`, `in no particular order`).
4. Optional jump line: `Or jump straight to our [FAQs](#anchor).`

### How-to / guide (e.g. reverse image search)

Reference: [how-to example](examples.md#how-to-reverse-image-search)

1. Lead with the task or problem in plain language.
2. **Explain why** in one or two short sentences.
3. Optional bullet list of outcomes (3–5 items) when it clarifies value.
4. Journey teaser: what platforms or steps the article covers.
5. Close with what they will learn by the end (one short sentence).

### Definition-first (e.g. "What Is SEO?")

Reference: [definition example](examples.md#definition-what-is-seo)

1. Open with the term and a tight definition (expand acronyms on first use).
2. One sentence on the user need and outcome (visibility, traffic, accuracy).
3. Optional short bullet list of what the practice involves.
4. Journey teaser: the main sections ahead.

### Debate / evidence piece

Reference: [debate example](examples.md#debate-intro-frame-a-fight)

1. Frame two extremes the reader has heard.
2. Position the article as the level-headed referee and name the method.
3. Promise a concrete payoff.
4. List the questions the article answers, in the order the H2s answer them.

## Writing rules

- **Short sentences.** Prefer 8–15 words. Break long lines into two sentences.
- **Keep it short.** 2–4 short paragraphs or 80–120 words unless the user asks for more.
- **Listicles:** mirror the count in the title (`three proven ways`, `five common mistakes`).
- **Voice:** direct, practical, confident. No hype words.
- **Emphasis (sparingly):** **bold** 2–4 hook words per intro (primary keyword, pain point, or outcome). Use _italic_ for one short aside or contrast. Never both on the same phrase.
- **No H2 in the intro** unless the outline starts with a definition block (`What Is X?`) right after the intro.
- The intro is the first prose block after frontmatter, not the meta description or excerpt.

## Slug, title, and image alt

- **Slug and title:** use the ones the user has. If not, propose one slug and one title that fit the intro.
- **Image alt:** describe the featured image for accessibility: subject plus context (mock UI, diagram, before/after). One sentence, under 125 characters when possible.

## Default output

Unless the user asks for `full`, `slug`, `title`, or `alt`, return only the intro: the markdown body paragraphs, ready to paste under frontmatter.

## Full output format

Use when the user asks for **`full`** or everything in one pass. Reference: [full output example](examples.md#full-output-definition-guide-ai-seo-style).

```markdown
**Slug:** `[slug]`

**Title:** [title]

**Image alt:** [one sentence, under 125 characters when possible]

**Intro:**

[1–2 sentences: definition or what the thing is]

[Optional: "That means…" + 2–4 short bullets: outcomes or jobs to be done]

[1–2 sentences: **explain why**, the practical stakes; use stats only if the user provided them]

**In this guide, you'll learn:**

- [Section or outcome 1](#heading-anchor)
- [Section or outcome 2](#another-anchor)
- [Section or outcome 3](#another-anchor)
- [Section or outcome 4](#another-anchor)

[One short closing line. Vary it; do not default to "Let's dive in."]
```

**Closing lines (pick one that fits; avoid repeating across a batch):**

- Here's how it works.
- Below is the full walkthrough.
- We'll break down each approach below.
- Here's what to know before you build.
- Use the sections below as your playbook.
- Read on for the step-by-step workflow.
- Here's how each platform compares.
- The rest of this guide covers it in order.

Rules for full output:

- Label fields with **Slug**, **Title**, **Image alt**, **Intro** so they are easy to copy.
- Use the heading **`In this guide, you'll learn:`** (or a close variant the user prefers).
- **Link each journey bullet** to the matching H2 anchor on the same post when the heading slugs are known. Anchors must match the live post.

## Quality check

Before returning, confirm:

- [ ] Reader intent matches the listicle, how-to, definition, or debate pattern
- [ ] Why the topic matters (practical, not abstract)
- [ ] Relevance to the reader's goal is clear
- [ ] Journey teaser names sections or outcomes
- [ ] Journey bullets link to real anchors in full output for existing posts
- [ ] 2–4 **bold** hooks and at most one _italic_ aside
- [ ] Sentences are short; total length is tight
- [ ] No fabricated data or competitor claims
