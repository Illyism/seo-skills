# AI SEO Tracker: agent setup skill

**Start here:** You are reading `https://aiseotracker.com/SKILL.md` (UTF-8 Markdown, available as `text/markdown` or `text/plain` through HTTP content negotiation). Do not guess MCP URLs, tool names, or pricing from memory. The file is complete only if the **last line** is page end `END SKILL v1.0.0`. If missing, re-fetch. Do not shell out or line-count to verify.

## TL;DR

- **Product:** Track how ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot (Bing AI Mode / Copilot Search in Bing), and Google AI Overviews mention a brand. Read prompts, sources, snippets, competitors, and scan state. Write tools: `aiseo_create_project`, `aiseo_add_prompts`, `aiseo_activate_plan` (checkout link, the user pays in the browser), and `aiseo_submit_feedback`.
- **Human path:** Sign up → create a project → run or buy a scan → read the dashboard at `/p/{slug}`.
- **Agent path:** Connect MCP once (OAuth, no API keys) → call `aiseo_list_projects` → answer from live tool JSON.
- **MCP URL:** `https://aiseotracker.com/api/agent/mcp` (Streamable HTTP). Prefer the URL from the user's **Settings → Agent** page when they give you a project slug.
- **Tools:** `aiseo_list_projects`, `aiseo_get_scan`, `aiseo_list_prompts`, `aiseo_list_sources`, `aiseo_get_source_history`, `aiseo_list_snippets`, `aiseo_list_competitors`, `aiseo_add_prompts`.
- **Scan wait:** Call `aiseo_get_scan`. `done` means no in-flight jobs, not that every prompt has results. Do not invent a subscribe tool. Do not poll `aiseo_list_prompts` to infer scan state.
- **Empty data:** `dataStatus: "no_data"` means no scan yet. Wait. Do not scrape the public site or invent ranks.
- **Paid scan:** **$49** one-time audit (50 prompts, 7-day scan week, permanent read access). Weekly plans from **$79/mo**. Details: [pricing](https://aiseotracker.com/pricing).

## Connect MCP (once)

There is **no static API key**. Auth is browser OAuth from the MCP client.

1. Add the MCP server URL in the client config. **No** `Authorization` header in the file.
2. First POST returns **401** + `agent_auth_required`. The client opens a browser. User signs in and Allow.
3. Later calls send a Bearer token. Tools run as **that user**.

### Cursor

Save as `.cursor/mcp.json` in the repo (or Settings → MCP):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aiseotracker": {
      "url": "https://aiseotracker.com/api/agent/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Reload. Settings → MCP → **Connect** next to `aiseotracker`.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http aiseotracker https://aiseotracker.com/api/agent/mcp
```

### Claude, Grok, ChatGPT

Add a custom MCP / connector with **only** the URL. Connect, then sign in and Allow.

Revoke access anytime at [account agents](https://aiseotracker.com/account/agents).

## Call order

1. **`aiseo_list_projects`:** get `projectSlug`. Never invent a slug.
2. Then as needed:
   - `aiseo_get_scan`: running vs done (`done` = idle jobs, not complete coverage)
   - `aiseo_list_prompts`: ranks, missing/opportunity prompts
   - `aiseo_list_sources`: domains and URLs AI cites
   - `aiseo_get_source_history`: whether one URL is still cited, per engine, and when it dropped
   - `aiseo_list_snippets`: how models describe the brand
   - `aiseo_list_competitors`: tracked rivals
3. **`aiseo_add_prompts`:** only for queries the **user asked** to track (max 20 per call).

## First prompt (after connect)

Paste in the same chat that has MCP connected:

> Call aiseo_list_projects. Use the first project (or the slug the user named). List missing prompts and the top citation domains. Summarize what to do this week. Do not invent ranks.

For the same brief as the in-app Report page, fetch `https://aiseotracker.com/ai-seo-report/SKILL.md` and follow it.

For a missing-prompt content campaign, fetch `https://aiseotracker.com/content-coverage/SKILL.md`. Stop for approval before writing files.

## Respond to a visibility request

1. **Confirm the brand:** domain or project name. Call `aiseo_list_projects` if unsure.
2. **Check data:** if a scan may still be running, call `aiseo_get_scan`. If `state` is `running`, call it again later. If `dataStatus` is `no_data`, say the project needs a scan (create at `/new` or wait).
3. **Answer from tool JSON only:** ranks, URLs, competitor names, snippet text.
4. **Stop at drafts:** briefs, outreach, Reddit comments. Do not send email, post publicly, or charge a card.

## What AI SEO Tracker does (and does not)

**Does:** Live AI mention and citation tracking, competitor gaps, MCP, $49 audit report.

**Does not:** Guarantee rankings, send outreach email, add competitors via MCP, or replace a full SEO strategy.

## Agent checklist

- [ ] Loaded this file (END marker present)
- [ ] MCP connected (or user told to connect from Settings → Agent)
- [ ] `aiseo_list_projects` called before other tools
- [ ] Every rank and URL copied from tool JSON
- [ ] Scan state checked with `aiseo_get_scan`, not by inventing ranks or a subscribe tool
- [ ] `dataStatus: no_data` handled without inventing data

## Do not

- Quote tool names or MCP URLs without loading this file
- Invent `projectSlug`, ranks, or citation URLs
- Treat `no_data` as an auth failure
- Call `aiseo_add_prompts` for queries the user did not ask to track
- Scrape the marketing site when MCP returns empty
