# SEO Title Optimization

Use this skill to improve page titles for search rankings and click-through rate.

## Core Rule

Treat the SERP as the brief.

Do not write titles from vibes. Identify the target query, study what already ranks when possible, then write the clearest title that matches the page and search intent.

## Title Formula

Start with:

```text
Primary keyword + modifier / benefit + brand
```

Examples:

- `Client Portal Software for Accountants`
- `Best AI Presentation Makers in 2026`
- `SEO Title Generator: Write Better Titles in 2026`
- `Emergency Plumber Dublin - 24/7 Same-Day Service`

## Checklist

For each title:

- Put the primary query near the front.
- Align `title`, meta description, H1, and URL slug around the same topic.
- Match the page type: pricing, support, docs, login, product, comparison, review, guide, pillar, definition, how-to, or listicle.
- Keep the important words visible before truncation.
- Use 40-55 characters as the ideal range when possible.
- Prefer human clarity over keyword stuffing.
- Make every title unique.
- Mirror SERP patterns when useful: `best`, `top`, numbers, year, comparison terms.
- Avoid useless titles like `Home`, `About`, `Products`, or vague category labels.
- Avoid changing slugs just to match temporary numbers or years.

## Blog Post Title Patterns

Use Semrush-style post templates to match the title to search intent:

- **Beginner guide:** use for beginners or new concepts. Pattern: `Beginner's Guide to [Topic]` or `[Topic]: What It Is & How to Use It`.
- **Pillar post:** use for broad evergreen topics. Pattern: `The Complete Guide to [Topic]`, `How to [X] (Basics, Tips & Resources)`, or `Everything You Need to Know About [Topic]`.
- **Definition post:** use for "what is" intent. Pattern: `What Is [Term]?` or `What Is [Term] & How to [Use It]`.
- **How-to post:** use for task intent. Pattern: `How to [Task]`, `How to [Task] Without [Obstacle]`, or `How to [Task] Like an Expert`.
- **Listicle:** use for rankings, curated tools, or summarized tips. Pattern: `10 [Things] to [Benefit]` or `[Number] Best [Tools/Ideas] for [Audience] in [Year]`.
- **Checklist:** use for task lists. Pattern: `[Topic] Checklist: [Number] Tips to [Outcome]`.
- **Comparison:** use for vs intent. Pattern: `[A] vs [B]: [Decision/Outcome]`.
- **Error/problem:** use for troubleshooting intent. Pattern: `What Does [Error] Mean?` or `How to Fix [Problem]`.

Pick one template per page. Do not mix title formats unless the SERP clearly does.

Useful modifiers: `Best`, `Top`, `Complete`, `Beginner's Guide`, `Examples`, `Template`, `Free`, `2026`, `Essential`.

Avoid hype-heavy modifiers unless the SERP supports them: `Shocking`, `Unbelievable`, `Jaw-dropping`, `Guaranteed`.

## Workflow

1. Identify the primary keyword or infer it from the page, slug, H1, and content.
2. Determine search intent: informational, commercial, transactional, local, comparison, pricing, support, docs, login, beginner guide, pillar, definition, how-to, or listicle.
3. If SERP/title data is available, compare top-ranking titles for repeated structures, modifiers, length, and wording.
4. Choose the post/page title pattern that best matches the intent.
5. Draft 3-5 title options.
6. Pick the title that is accurate, concise, and most likely to earn the click.
7. If editing files, update frontmatter `title` and only adjust H1/meta/slug when the user asked or the mismatch is clearly harmful.
8. For bulk work, return a before/after table and explain the pattern used.

## Common Fixes

**Too vague**

```text
Home
```

Becomes:

```text
AI Customer Support Chatbot for SaaS Teams
```

**Too bloated**

```text
The Ultimate Complete Guide to the Many Benefits of Digital Signage for Businesses
```

Becomes:

```text
8 Digital Signage Benefits for Businesses
```

**Wrong page intent**

```text
Plans for Growing Teams
```

Becomes:

```text
Client Portal Pricing
```

## Bulk Rewrite Output

When auditing multiple pages, use this format:

```markdown
| Page       | Current title | Suggested title                          | Why                                 |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/example` | `Home`        | `Client Portal Software for Accountants` | Adds main query and product clarity |
```

Keep explanations short. The output should help the user approve or edit quickly.
